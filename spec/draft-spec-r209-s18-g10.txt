                     draft-ietf-xml2rfc-template-05

Abstract

   The document is a specification for a session protocol capable of
   supporting the application Chat While Watching(c2w).The protocol is
   used between clients and a server.  The goal of this protocol is to
   allow a client to chat with other users in the main room or movie
   room.

1.  Introduction

   The goal of the c2w protocol specification is to allow clients to
   chat with other users in the main room or movie room.  For the sake
   of simplicity, the message format is the same for all the messages.
   This protocol is able to be implemented either with TCP or UDP.

1.1.  Functions

   When a client logins in to the server, he/she enters the name(or IP
   address) and the port number of the server as well as his/her user-
   name in the login window.  If the user-name is already used by other
   client, this client will receive an error message from the server.

   If login is successful, this client will be directed to the "main
   room" and the server send two messages to this client,one is the list
   of all users in the system(specifying whether they are available
   "A"(they are in the main room)or whether they are in a Movie room
   "M"), the other is the list of all the available movies.  The user
   can send messages to other users in the main room.

   While in the "main room", the user can join one of the movies, the
   application shows a third window with the list of all the users in
   this movie room.The user can send messages to other users in the
   movie room and leave the movie room to go back to the main room.

   The user can leave the main room and go back to the login window.

2.  Message format

   All messages have the same format, shown in figure Figure 1.

   * ACK field(1 bit): This field indicates whether 1: the message is
   well received by the server as well as it is well executed.  0: the
   message is well received be the server, but the message makes the
   error.

   * Type field (4 bits) : This field indicates the type of each message
   (refer to a table (definition of the type) for more details).

   * Text Length field (16 bits): This field specifies the total length
   in bytes of the Text.  The user MUST ensure that this field contains
   the correct value.

   * Text field (variable length): This field contains the contente that
   is the object of the message, encoded in ASCII.

4.  Example scenario

4.1.  Scenario 1: Login

   This first scenario describes the case where a new client 'Alice'.
   Alice sends a Login Request to the server.  Once the server receives
   that request, he will judge whether the login request is legal, if
   correct the server will send the ML(movie list) and UL(user list) to
   Alice, then again the server will send the new UL to other users(i.g.
   one man called Paul) in the MR(main room).In this case, we assume
   that it exists just one film called "pulp fiction" in the ML, and the
   users are Alice and Paul.
